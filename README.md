# grep
grep command

I have implemented 12 options (-i, -c, -v, -h, -H, -w, -b, -m, -q, -r, -f, -e) of the grep command in my project.

I have also implemented the combinations of the above options.

I have used array of Structures for storing patterns and their indices for -f and -e option.

Test Files contains some files and directories on which the commands were tested.

test.txt contains a summary of commands which were tested. User can test any other combination of the above options on it.

dep.c contains the function definitions which are used in grep.c.

./run is the executable file
